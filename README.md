# DSA

## Kadane's Algorithm
- This algorithmworks to find the maximum subarray .
- It traverses through the array and computes the maximum sum but if in case the current sum goes below zero then we reset the current sum
- [code](https://github.com/roystondz/DSA/blob/main/53MaxSubArray.cpp)


## Moore's Algorithm
- This algorithm is used to find the majority element
- we traverse through the loop and at first we assign answer as the first element . Every time we get the same element we f++ or else if we dont f--

## Binary Exponentiation
- Pow(x,n)
- [code](https://github.com/roystondz/DSA/blob/main/50Pow(x%2Cn).cpp)

## Buy and Sell

## Conatiner with most water
- Brute force approach (TLE)
- [code](https://github.com/roystondz/DSA/blob/main/11ContainerWater.cpp)
- Optimal approach with two pointer
